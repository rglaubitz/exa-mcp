# MCP Server Evaluation Guide

## Overview

This document provides guidance on creating comprehensive evaluations for MCP servers. Evaluations test whether LLMs can effectively use your MCP server to answer realistic, complex questions using only the tools provided.

---

## Quick Reference

### Evaluation Requirements

- Create 10 human-readable questions
- Questions must be READ-ONLY, INDEPENDENT, NON-DESTRUCTIVE
- Each question requires multiple tool calls (potentially dozens)
- Answers must be single, verifiable values
- Answers must be STABLE (won't change over time)

### Output Format

```xml
<evaluation>
   <qa_pair>
      <question>Your question here</question>
      <answer>Single verifiable answer</answer>
   </qa_pair>
</evaluation>
```

## Purpose of Evaluations

The measure of quality of an MCP server is NOT how well or comprehensively the server implements tools, but how well these implementations (input/output schemas, docstrings/descriptions, functionality) enable LLMs with no other context and access ONLY to the MCP servers to answer realistic and difficult questions.

## Evaluation Overview

Create 10 human-readable questions requiring ONLY READ-ONLY, INDEPENDENT, NON-DESTRUCTIVE, and IDEMPOTENT operations to answer. Each question should be:

- Realistic
- Clear and concise
- Unambiguous
- Complex, requiring potentially dozens of tool calls or steps
- Answerable with a single, verifiable value that you identify in advance

## Question Guidelines

### Core Requirements

1. **Questions MUST be independent**
   - Each question should NOT depend on the answer to any other question
   - Should not assume prior write operations from processing another question

2. **Questions MUST require ONLY NON-DESTRUCTIVE AND IDEMPOTENT tool use**
   - Should not instruct or require modifying state to arrive at the correct answer

3. **Questions must be REALISTIC, CLEAR, CONCISE, and COMPLEX**
   - Must require another LLM to use multiple (potentially dozens of) tools or steps to answer

### Complexity and Depth

4. **Questions must require deep exploration**
   - Consider multi-hop questions requiring multiple sub-questions and sequential tool calls
   - Each step should benefit from information found in previous questions

5. **Questions may require extensive paging**
   - May need paging through multiple pages of results
   - May require querying old data (1-2 years out-of-date) to find niche information
   - The questions must be DIFFICULT

6. **Questions must require deep understanding**
   - Rather than surface-level knowledge
   - May pose complex ideas as True/False questions requiring evidence
   - May use multiple-choice format where LLM must search different hypotheses

7. **Questions must not be solvable with straightforward keyword search**
   - Do not include specific keywords from the target content
   - Use synonyms, related concepts, or paraphrases
   - Require multiple searches, analyzing multiple related items, extracting context, then deriving the answer

### Tool Testing

8. **Questions should stress-test tool return values**
   - May elicit tools returning large JSON objects or lists, overwhelming the LLM
   - Should require understanding multiple modalities of data:
     - IDs and names
     - Timestamps and datetimes (months, days, years, seconds)
     - File IDs, names, extensions, and mimetypes
     - URLs, GIDs, etc.
   - Should probe the tool's ability to return all useful forms of data

9. **Questions should MOSTLY reflect real human use cases**
   - The kinds of information retrieval tasks that HUMANS assisted by an LLM would care about

10. **Questions may require dozens of tool calls**
    - This challenges LLMs with limited context
    - Encourages MCP server tools to reduce information returned

11. **Include ambiguous questions**
    - May be ambiguous OR require difficult decisions on which tools to call
    - Force the LLM to potentially make mistakes or misinterpret
    - Ensure that despite AMBIGUITY, there is STILL A SINGLE VERIFIABLE ANSWER

### Stability

12. **Questions must be designed so the answer DOES NOT CHANGE**
    - Do not ask questions that rely on "current state" which is dynamic
    - For example, do not count:
      - Number of reactions to a post
      - Number of replies to a thread
      - Number of members in a channel

13. **DO NOT let the MCP server RESTRICT the kinds of questions you create**
    - Create challenging and complex questions
    - Some may not be solvable with the available MCP server tools
    - Questions may require specific output formats (datetime vs. epoch time, JSON vs. MARKDOWN)
    - Questions may require dozens of tool calls to complete

## Answer Guidelines

### Verification

1. **Answers must be VERIFIABLE via direct string comparison**
   - If the answer can be re-written in many formats, clearly specify the output format in the QUESTION
   - Examples: "Use YYYY/MM/DD.", "Respond True or False.", "Answer A, B, C, or D and nothing else."
   - Answer should be a single VERIFIABLE value such as:
     - User ID, user name, display name, first name, last name
     - Channel ID, channel name
     - Message ID, string
     - URL, title
     - Numerical quantity
     - Timestamp, datetime
     - Boolean (for True/False questions)
     - Email address, phone number
     - File ID, file name, file extension
     - Multiple choice answer
   - Answers must not require special formatting or complex, structured output
   - Answer will be verified using DIRECT STRING COMPARISON

### Readability

2. **Answers should generally prefer HUMAN-READABLE formats**
   - Examples: names, first name, last name, datetime, file name, message string, URL, yes/no, true/false, a/b/c/d
   - Rather than opaque IDs (though IDs are acceptable)
   - The VAST MAJORITY of answers should be human-readable

### Stability

3. **Answers must be STABLE/STATIONARY**
   - Look at old content (e.g., conversations that have ended, projects that have launched, questions answered)
   - Create QUESTIONS based on "closed" concepts that will always return the same answer
   - Questions may ask to consider a fixed time window to insulate from non-stationary answers
   - Rely on context UNLIKELY to change
   - Example: if finding a paper name, be SPECIFIC enough so answer is not confused with papers published later

4. **Answers must be CLEAR and UNAMBIGUOUS**
   - Questions must be designed so there is a single, clear answer
   - Answer can be derived from using the MCP server tools

### Diversity

5. **Answers must be DIVERSE**
   - Answer should be a single VERIFIABLE value in diverse modalities and formats
   - User concept: user ID, user name, display name, first name, last name, email address, phone number
   - Channel concept: channel ID, channel name, channel topic
   - Message concept: message ID, message string, timestamp, month, day, year

6. **Answers must NOT be complex structures**
   - Not a list of values
   - Not a complex object
   - Not a list of IDs or strings
   - Not natural language text
   - UNLESS the answer can be straightforwardly verified using DIRECT STRING COMPARISON
   - And can be realistically reproduced
   - It should be unlikely that an LLM would return the same list in any other order or format

## Running Evaluations

After creating your evaluation file, you can use the provided evaluation harness to test your MCP server.

### Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
   ```

   Or install manually:

   ```bash
   pip install anthropic mcp
   ```

2. **Set API Key**

   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

### Running Evaluations

The evaluation script (`scripts/evaluation.py`) supports three transport types:

**Important:**

- **stdio transport**: The evaluation script automatically launches and manages the MCP server process for you. Do not run the server manually.
- **sse/http transports**: You must start the MCP server separately before running the evaluation. The script connects to the already-running server at the specified URL.

#### 1. Local STDIO Server

For locally-run MCP servers (script launches the server automatically):

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a my_mcp_server.py \
  evaluation.xml
```

With environment variables:

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a my_mcp_server.py \
  -e API_KEY=abc123 \
  -e DEBUG=true \
  evaluation.xml
```

#### 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE)

For SSE-based MCP servers (you must start the server first):

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t sse \
  -u https://example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  -H "X-Custom-Header: value" \
  evaluation.xml
```

#### 3. HTTP (Streamable HTTP)

For HTTP-based MCP servers (you must start the server first):

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t http \
  -u https://example.com/mcp \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer token123" \
  evaluation.xml
```

### Command-Line Options

- **Summary Statistics**:
  - Accuracy (correct/total)
  - Average task duration
  - Average tool calls per task
  - Total tool calls

- **Per-Task Results**:
  - Prompt and expected response
  - Actual response from the agent
  - Whether the answer was correct
  - Duration and tool call details
  - Agent's summary of its approach
  - Agent's feedback on the tools

### Save Report to File

```bash
python scripts/evaluation.py \
  -t stdio \
  -c python \
  -a my_server.py \
  -o evaluation_report.md \
  evaluation.xml
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors

If you get connection errors:

- **STDIO**: Verify the command and arguments are correct
- **SSE/HTTP**: Check the URL is accessible and headers are correct
- Ensure any required API keys are set in environment variables or headers

### Low Accuracy

If many evaluations fail:

- Review the agent's feedback for each task
- Check if tool descriptions are clear and comprehensive
- Verify input parameters are well-documented
- Consider whether tools return too much or too little data
- Ensure error messages are actionable

### Timeout Issues

If tasks are timing out:

- Use a more capable model (e.g., `claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219`)
- Check if tools are returning too much data
- Verify pagination is working correctly
- Consider simplifying complex questions
